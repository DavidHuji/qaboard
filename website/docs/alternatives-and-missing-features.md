## Non-features
QA-Board works with other tools. It won't replace or provide:
- **Automation:** You should call QA-Board's client, `qa`, in your CI. If you're looking for a CI plaform, consider [GitlabCI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [DroneCI](https://github.com/drone/drone), etc.
- **Monitoring, Deployement & Ops**: in this space solutions tend to be custom, industry specific, and have a *short* life. Get in touch if you see low-hanging fruits!
- **Data Versionning**

## Why not use X instead?
- Most comparable tools focus on **training for machine learning** (`sacred`, `nni`, `mlflow`, `tensorboard`, `polyaxon`...). Our use cases revolve around qualitative outputs for a wide range of algorithms. It means we *need* powerful visualizations. This said, those tools are great too! Many of the commercial solutions (`cometML`, `convrg.io`, `netpune.ai`...) can provide a lot of value too depending on your use-case and the size/maturity of your organization.
- **Notebooks** are amazing for experimentation and r&d reporting, but are not easy to compare. 
- [`tensorboard`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) has a lot of qualities, but it doesn't scale to many experiments, doesn't know about `git`, and is not persistent. We may integrate an "Open in Tensorboard" button, ask about it and stay tuned. As for `visdom`, it's great for experimenting, less to store historical information.
