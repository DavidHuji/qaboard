# Each qaboard.yaml in your repository will be a separate QA-Board project
#
#
# Configuration is inherited from the parent projects, merged deeply
#
# All the paths you use here are meant relative to the root of the repository
# When using qa commands, the working directory will change to the repository root 
#
# We support a tiny bit of magic for common use-cases
# Let's say you want to append a visualization to ones defined in parent projects,
# You can do this
#
# outputs:
#   visualizations
#   - super
#   - path: output.jpg
#     name: My new output
